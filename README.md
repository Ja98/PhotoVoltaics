# PhotoVoltaics

Modelica library for the simulation of photo voltaic cells, modules and plants. The library provides:
 - Simple cell models based on one diode and a irradiance dependent current source including temperature dependence of the open circuit voltage and the short circuit current
 - Simple symmetric modules and non-symmetric module including shading of cells
 - Simple symmetric plant 
 - Data of commercial modules stored in Modelica Records for convinient investigations
 - Analytical irradiance model without weather conditions
 - Single and three phase quasi static converters
 - Maximum power tracker based on contiuous voltage regulation
